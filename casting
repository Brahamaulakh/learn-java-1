//casting
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // casting and type conversions
        short x =1;
        int y = x+2;
        System.out.println(y);  // result will be 3 due to implicite or automatic casting

        /* how did that happen ?
        first java look at the value of x ,that is 1,
        now java will allocate another anonymous variable
        some where in memory , that variable will be int and
        at last java will copy the value of x in that memory
        space

        this automatic or casting happens while converting
        smaller to bigger memory space
        like

        byte>short>int>long>float>double
         */

        // explicite casting
        double a = 1.1;
        double b = a + 2;
        System.out.println(b);// the result will be 3.1

        // but if we want the result to be 3

        double c = 1.1;
        int d = (int)c + 2;
        System.out.println(d);
        }
     }
